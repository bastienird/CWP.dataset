<!-- WARNING - This vignette is generated by {fusen} from dev/flat_first.Rmd: do not edit by hand -->


<!-- Run this 'development' chunk -->
<!-- Store every call to library() that you need to explore your functions -->

<!--
 You need to run the 'description' chunk in the '0-dev_history.Rmd' file before continuing your code there.

If it is the first time you use {fusen}, after 'description', you can directly run the last chunk of the present file with inflate() inside.
--> 

# Include some data examples in your package

<!-- 
 Store your dataset in a directory named "inst/" at the root of your project.
 Use it for your tests in this Rmd thanks to `pkgload::load_all()` to make it available
and `system.file()` to read it in your examples.

- There already is a dataset in the "inst/" directory to be used in the examples below
-->


<!--
Create a chunk for the core of the function

- The chunk needs to be named `function` at least
- It contains the code of a documented function
- The chunk can also be named `function-my_median` to make it easily
findable in your Rmd
- Let the `@examples` part empty, and use the next `examples` chunk instead to present reproducible examples

After inflating the template

-  This function code will automatically be added in a new file in the "R/" directory
-->

```{r example-read_data}
# Example: Reading a CSV file
# csv_data <- read_data(here::here("inst/CWP_dataset.csv"))
# head(csv_data)  # Display the first few rows

```




# Last path to be handled in workflow 
```{r last_path}
#' Extract Last Part of a File Path
#'
#' @description This function returns the last part of a file path after removing a specific suffix.
#' @param x A character string representing the file path.
#' @return A character string representing the last part of the file path.
#' @export
last_path <- function(x){
  x <- gsub("/rds.rds", "", x)
  substr(x, max(gregexpr("/", x)[[1]]) + 1, nchar(x))
}
```




```{r last_path_reduced}
#' Reduce Last Path for Georeferenced Datasets
#'
#' @description This function modifies the last path by removing specific substrings for clarity.
#' @param x A character string representing the file path.
#' @return A character string representing the modified last path.
#' @export
last_path_reduced <- function(x) {
  gsub("georef_dataset", "", last_path(x))
}
```


# Functions for reporting 


## Plots and maps 







# Comparison between multiple CWP datasets





<!--
# There can be development actions

Create a chunk with 'development' actions

- The chunk needs to be named `development` or `dev`
- It contains functions that are used for package development only
- Note that you may want to store most of these functions in the 0-dev_history.Rmd file

These are only included in the present flat template file, their content will not be part of the package anywhere else.

### Function Definitions

#### Function: function_multiple_comparison

### Tests

#### Test: function_multiple_comparison


# Inflate your package

You're one inflate from paper to box.
Build your package from this very Rmd using `fusen::inflate()`

- Verify your `"DESCRIPTION"` file has been updated
- Verify your function is in `"R/"` directory
- Verify your test is in `"tests/testthat/"` directory
- Verify this Rmd appears in `"vignettes/"` directory
